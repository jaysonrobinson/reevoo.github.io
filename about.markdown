# About Reevoo Engineering.

We love [TTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and [Continuous delivery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery). We write in Ruby, NodeJS, Java, PHP, C# and use languages such as Chef for deployment onto AWS.

Our team works in an _agile_ (the most overused word in the software lingo) manner to deliver great work in small iterations.
