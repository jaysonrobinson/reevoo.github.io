The debate corporate vs start-up has been on for a long time, however the differences between the two worlds were not completly clear to me until recently.

As a student in Computer Science at two of the top-ranked universities in UK, we were introduced to the computing industry by a series of careers-fair events, presentations, talks etc.
The majority of the companies that attended these events were big names, companies that “everybody wants to work for”, leaving the fresh start-ups and small companies not well represented.
In my opinion, the projection of the employment opportunities available to us, through these kind of events, triggers a certain desire between the students to join famous graduate programs, with competitive salaries and plenty of benefits.

During my studies I completed two 3-months internships abroad for a 100.000+ employees company. Then I graduated and almost 4 months ago I joined Reevoo, which is a 100+ tech company based in London.

First of all, in my experience, the job application processes for the corporate companies were always long and cumbersome. On the other side, applying for a start-up it is much more simple and straightforward, and you end up with an answer in less than a week.

The number of employees is an important factor when deciding the practices and organisation of a team. Therefore, even though both companies are using agile development methodologies, it was only at Reevoo that I had the chance to try some of the agile practices that I found most interesting: pair programming and TDD (test driven development).

By pairing with senior developers I was able  to learn at a very fast pace. Switching the pairs every day or every few days is a great way to share knowledge, and I appreciate this method of learning much more than the traditional training programs. It is very challenging for a junior developer to sit from day 1 next to a senior developer and try to get up to speed by building real features and delivering deployable code.   
As a junior developer I found that the knowledge that I gained in these last few months is extremely valuable and practical. 

At Reevoo I was given more responsibility and I also had more interaction with the different teams that are in the company. I have a general feeling that everybody is working to achieve a common goal, and everybody is willing to share their work and consolidate the knowledge of the company. The creative thinking is very much encouraged and you have the ownership of the product you are trying to build. 

I would like to encourage all the students and graduates to try the two worlds before deciding which one is more suitable for them and in the meantime I would like to encourage the start-ups to attend the careers-fairs  events and to try to promote more their values and practices. Simplicity, hard-work, creativity, and knowledge sharing are probably some of the best careers skills that one can get.
