_NB: this post is factitious and should be taken lightly._

Grady Booch wrote about this [a long time ago](http://web.archive.org/web/20050203010041/http://www.manamplified.org/archives/000203.html). It was written as a response to __Test Driven Development__ (TDD). A jest-ful post, but also serious, discussing the importance of accepting that some decisions have to be made before any steps can be taken.

_And that these steps were stressful and important._
