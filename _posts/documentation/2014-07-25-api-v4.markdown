# The **Reevoo Platform API** is a simple read only API that returns product scores and published reviews as json.

# Access
Our Client Services team can provide a key and secret to access the API, there is also a
demo_key which can be used for development and testing without a real key. V4 of the
platform API uses HTTP Basic Authentication.

The API is hosted on [https://api.reevoocloud.com/v4/](https://api.reevoocloud.com/v4/).

# Version
The most recent version of the Reevoo API, Version 4, is included as part of the URL (V4).
The API will provide our clients with direct access to published ratings and review data,
covering both product and customer experience reviews.

Version 4 of the API is currently live in Beta-mode which means that we will expose any
additional data end-points included in the API incrementally, following client demand. Any
changes or additions made to the API will be reflected in the API documentation and our
clients using API Version 4 will be notified of any updates.
